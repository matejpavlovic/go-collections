# go-collections

This is a collection of useful functions for working with slices and maps in Go (1.18 and above).
The functions are so simple that the function signatures and a few comments directly in the code
can serve as documentation.

This code has been put together over time while working on the [Mir project](https://github.com/matejpavlovic/mir).
It was created in collaboration with and with significant contributions of [Andrei Tonkikh](https://github.com/xosmig)
and [Alejandro Ranchal-Pedrosa](https://github.com/ranchalp).
